        <p className="mb-4">
          Hi, I'm Frida, a Fullstack Developer with a deep passion for coding
          and a relentless drive, some would call it stubborness, to solve
          problems. I love diving into code, solving problems, and continuously
          learn new things. I approach every challenge with a positive attitude
          and a determination to see it through.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Beyond my technical skills, I'm all about clear communication and
          truly understanding what users need. This approach helps me
          collaborate effectively with others and ensures we're delivering
          solutions that matter. I also have a growing interest in design, which
          guides my work in creating not just functional, but also visually
          appealing and user-friendly applications. I'm excited to keep
          learning, growing, and contributing to projects that make a
          difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I often enjoy a good book, which allows me to
          explore new ideas that often spark my creativity and bring fresh
          perspectives. I also love video games. A good game keeps my
          problem-solving skills sharp and my focus laser-tight. And, of course,
          spending time with animals is a joy that reminds me to appreciate the
          simple things in life. Their companionship adds a touch of balance to
          my busy days. üêà

          At Clira, I had the opportunity to help develop and maintain an
          innovative procurement system. Using Laravel and Next.js, I was part
          of building a platform that was both efficient and user-friendly. My
          role involved optimizing backend processes to keep things running
          smoothly and ensuring the system was reliable and scalable. I also
          took part in code reviews and troubleshooting, collaborating with my
          team to maintain high standards and keep the system stable. This
          experience not only improved my technical skills but also gave me a
          deeper understanding of good software development practices.

          At Djurens R√§tt, I developed web applications using Nuxt.js to support
          the nonprofit's mission. I worked on implementing authentication with
          Auth0 and integrated various third-party APIs to enhance
          functionality. Collaborating closely with the design team, I helped
          ensure that the user experience was smooth and cohesive. I also
          assisted in deploying code and maintaining the applications, helping
          to keep everything running smoothly.

          I completed the Fullstack Web Developer program at Chas Academy, where
          I gained a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end
          development. During the program, I worked on practical projects that
          helped me get comfortable with technologies like JavaScript, PHP,
          HTML/CSS, and various back-end tools. The focus wasn't just on coding
          but also on teamwork, problem-solving, and creating user-friendly
          applications. This experience gave me the skills and confidence to
          kickstart my career as a fullstack developer.
